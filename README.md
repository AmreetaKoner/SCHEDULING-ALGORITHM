# SCHEDULING-ALGORITHM
This project deals with the simulation of CPU scheduling
algorithms with C. The following algorithms are simulated: 
First Come First Serve(FCFS)
Shortest Job First(SJF)
SRTF Algorithm
Round Robin
Updated RR algorithm 
 
The metrics such as finishing time, waiting time, total timetaken for the processes to complete, number of rounds, etc are calculated. 

Multiprogramming is an important aspect of operating systems (OS); it requires several processes to be kept simultaneously in the memory, the aim of which is maximum CPU utilization. 
Among other CPU scheduling algorithms, like the First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF) and Priority Scheduling (PS); Round Robin is considered the most widely used scheduling algorithm in time sharing and real time OS for allocating the CPU to the processes in the memory in order to achieve the aim mentioned above. 

This paper proposed a more improvement in the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm by improving the algorithm by Manish and AbdulKadir. 
By experimental analysis, this proposed algorithm performs better than the simple Round Robin and the Improved Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithms in terms of minimizing average waiting time, average turnaround time and number of context switches.
